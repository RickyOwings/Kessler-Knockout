# Kessler-Knockout

This is and old project that I made when I was getting into programming. I uploaded it to github so that people could play it via
github pages.

The name is based off of this idea called Kessler Syndrome. Kessler Syndrome is this idea in Orbital Mechanics that when two
sattelites crash in orbit around earth, they will emit millions of particles from the collision. This will then create a
domino effect, where those particles will collide with more sattilites, creating more particles in the process.

There are a lot of apsects of the code that could definetely be way better, but it was one of my first projects that I made, so
there is a certain beauty in how I got it working without having knowledge of how everything works in programming yet...
